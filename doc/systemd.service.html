    by the same name (with the <code class="filename">.service</code> suffix
    removed) and dynamically creates a service unit from that script.
    This is useful for compatibility with SysV. Note that this
    compatibility is quite comprehensive but not 100%. For details
    about the incompatibilities, see the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities" target="_top">Incompatibilities

            specified but neither <code class="varname">Type=</code> nor <code class="varname">BusName=</code> are), the service manager
            will consider the unit started immediately after the main service process has been forked off. It is
            expected that the process configured with <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> is the main process of the
            service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to other processes on the system, its
            communication channels should be installed before the service is started up (e.g.  sockets set up by
            systemd, via socket activation), as the service manager will immediately proceed starting follow-up units,
            right after creating the main service process, and before executing the service's binary. Note that this
            means <span class="command"><strong>systemctl start</strong></span> command lines for <code class="option">simple</code> services will report
            success even if the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for example because the selected
            <code class="varname">User=</code> doesn't exist, or the service binary is missing).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="option">exec</code> type is similar to <code class="option">simple</code>, but the service
            manager will consider the unit started immediately after the main service binary has been executed. The service
            manager will delay starting of follow-up units until that point. (Or in other words:
            <code class="option">simple</code> proceeds with further jobs right after <code class="function">fork()</code> returns, while
            <code class="option">exec</code> will not proceed before both <code class="function">fork()</code> and
            <code class="function">execve()</code> in the service process succeeded.) Note that this means <span class="command"><strong>systemctl
            start</strong></span> command lines for <code class="option">exec</code> services will report failure when the service's
            binary cannot be invoked successfully (for example because the selected <code class="varname">User=</code> doesn't
            exist, or the service binary is missing).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If set to <code class="option">forking</code>, it is expected that the process configured with
            <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> will call <code class="function">fork()</code> as part of its start-up. The parent
            process is expected to exit when start-up is complete and all communication channels are set up. The child
            continues to run as the main service process, and the service manager will consider the unit started when
            the parent process exits. This is the behavior of traditional UNIX services. If this setting is used, it is
            recommended to also use the <code class="varname">PIDFile=</code> option, so that systemd can reliably identify the
            main process of the service. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units as soon as the parent
            process exits.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Behavior of <code class="option">oneshot</code> is similar to <code class="option">simple</code>;
            however, the service manager will consider the unit up after the main process exits. It will then
            start follow-up units. <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code> is particularly useful for this type
            of service. <code class="varname">Type=</code><code class="option">oneshot</code> is the implied default if neither
            <code class="varname">Type=</code> nor <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> are specified. Note that if this
            option is used without <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code> the service will never enter
            "<code class="literal">active</code>" unit state, but directly transition from "<code class="literal">activating</code>"
            to "<code class="literal">deactivating</code>" or "<code class="literal">dead</code>" since no process is configured that
            shall run continously. In particular this means that after a service of this type ran (and which
            has <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code> not set) it will not show up as started afterwards, but
            as dead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Behavior of <code class="option">dbus</code> is similar to <code class="option">simple</code>; however, it is
            expected that the service acquires a name on the D-Bus bus, as configured by
            <code class="varname">BusName=</code>. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after the D-Bus bus name
            has been acquired. Service units with this option configured implicitly gain dependencies on the
            <code class="filename">dbus.socket</code> unit. This type is the default if <code class="varname">BusName=</code> is
            specified.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Behavior of <code class="option">notify</code> is similar to <code class="option">exec</code>; however, it is
            expected that the service sends a notification message via
            <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sd_notify</span>(3)</span></a> or an
            equivalent call when it has finished starting up. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after
            this notification message has been sent. If this option is used, <code class="varname">NotifyAccess=</code> (see
            below) should be set to open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If
            <code class="varname">NotifyAccess=</code> is missing or set to <code class="option">none</code>, it will be forcibly set to
            <code class="option">main</code>. Note that currently <code class="varname">Type=</code><code class="option">notify</code> will not work if
            used in combination with <code class="varname">PrivateNetwork=</code><code class="option">yes</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Behavior of <code class="option">idle</code> is very similar to <code class="option">simple</code>; however,
            actual execution of the service program is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched. This may be used
            to avoid interleaving of output of shell services with the status output on the console. Note that this
            type is useful only to improve console output, it is not useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the
            effect of this service type is subject to a 5s timeout, after which the service program is invoked
            anyway.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is generally recommended to use <code class="varname">Type=</code><code class="option">simple</code> for long-running
          services whenever possible, as it is the simplest and fastest option. However, as this service type won't
          propagate service start-up failures and doesn't allow ordering of other units against completion of
          initialization of the service (which for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through
          some form of IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself — in contrast to doing this
          ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not be sufficient for many cases. If so,
          <code class="option">notify</code> or <code class="option">dbus</code> (the latter only in case the service provides a D-Bus
          interface) are the preferred options as they allow service program code to precisely schedule when to
          consider the service started up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The
          <code class="option">notify</code> service type requires explicit support in the service codebase (as
          <code class="function">sd_notify()</code> or an equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate
          time) — if it's not supported, then <code class="option">forking</code> is an alternative: it supports the traditional
          UNIX service start-up protocol. Finally, <code class="option">exec</code> might be an option for cases where it is
          enough to ensure the service binary is invoked, and where the service binary itself executes no or little
          initialization on its own (and its initialization is unlikely to fail). Note that using any type other than
          <code class="option">simple</code> possibly delays the boot process, as the service manager needs to wait for service
          initialization to complete. It is hence recommended not to needlessly use any types other than
          <code class="option">simple</code>. (Also note it is generally not recommended to use <code class="option">idle</code> or
          <code class="option">oneshot</code> for long-running services.)</p></dd><dt id="RemainAfterExit="><span class="term"><code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="#RemainAfterExit=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>Takes a boolean value that specifies whether

        file after start-up of the service. The service manager will not write to the file configured here, although it
        will remove the file after the service has shut down if it still exists. The PID file does not need to be owned
        by a privileged user, but if it is owned by an unprivileged user additional safety restrictions are enforced:
        the file may not be a symlink to a file owned by a different user (neither directly nor indirectly), and the

    as "<code class="literal">\;</code>".</p><p>Each command line is split on whitespace, with the first item being the command to
    execute, and the subsequent items being the arguments. Double quotes ("…") and single quotes
    ('…') may be used to wrap a whole item (the opening quote may appear only at the beginning or
    after whitespace that is not quoted, and the closing quote must be followed by whitespace or the
    end of line), in which case everything until the next matching quote becomes part of the same
    argument. Quotes themselves are removed. C-style escapes are also supported. The table below
    contains the list of known escape patterns. Only escape patterns which match the syntax in the
    table are allowed; other patterns may be added in the future and unknown patterns will result in
    a warning. In particular, any backslashes should be doubled. Finally, a trailing backslash
    ("<code class="literal">\</code>") may be used to merge lines.</p><p>This syntax is inspired by shell syntax, but only the meta-characters and expansions
    described in the following paragraphs are understood, and the expansion of variables is
    different. Specifically, redirection using
    "<code class="literal">&lt;</code>",
    "<code class="literal">&lt;&lt;</code>",
    "<code class="literal">&gt;</code>", and
    "<code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code>", pipes using
    "<code class="literal">|</code>", running programs in the background using
    "<code class="literal">&amp;</code>", and <span class="emphasis"><em>other elements of shell
    syntax are not supported</em></span>.</p><p>The command to execute may contain spaces, but control characters are not allowed.</p><p>The command line accepts "<code class="literal">%</code>" specifiers as described in

    "<code class="literal">${FOO}</code>" as part of a word, or as a word of its
    own, on the command line, in which case it will be replaced by the
    value of the environment variable including all whitespace it
    contains, resulting in a single argument. Use
    "<code class="literal">$FOO</code>" as a separate word on the command line, in
    which case it will be replaced by the value of the environment
    variable split at whitespace, resulting in zero or more arguments.
    For this type of expansion, quotes are respected when splitting
    into words, and afterwards removed.</p><p>If the command is not a full (absolute) path, it will be resolved to a full path using a
    fixed search path determinted at compilation time. Searched directories include
    <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin/</code>, <code class="filename">/usr/bin/</code>, <code class="filename">/bin/</code>
    on systems using split <code class="filename">/usr/bin/</code> and <code class="filename">/bin/</code>
    directories, and their <code class="filename">sbin/</code> counterparts on systems using split
    <code class="filename">bin/</code> and <code class="filename">sbin/</code>. It is thus safe to use just the
    executable name in case of executables located in any of the "standard" directories, and an
    absolute path must be used in other cases. Using an absolute path is recommended to avoid
    ambiguity. Hint: this search path may be queried using
    <span class="command"><strong>systemd-path search-binaries-default</strong></span>.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Environment="ONE=one" 'TWO=two two'
ExecStart=echo $ONE $TWO ${TWO}</pre><p>This will execute <span class="command"><strong>/bin/echo</strong></span> with four
    arguments: "<code class="literal">one</code>", "<code class="literal">two</code>",
    "<code class="literal">two</code>", and "<code class="literal">two two</code>".</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Environment=ONE='one' "TWO='two&nbsp;two'&nbsp;too" THREE=
ExecStart=/bin/echo ${ONE} ${TWO} ${THREE}
ExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO $THREE</pre><p>This results in <code class="filename">/bin/echo</code> being
    called twice, the first time with arguments
    "<code class="literal">'one'</code>",
    "<code class="literal">'two&nbsp;two'&nbsp;too</code>", "<code class="literal"></code>",
    and the second time with arguments

    Variables whose value is not known at expansion time are treated
    as empty strings. Note that the first argument (i.e. the program
    to execute) may not be a variable.</p><p>Variables to be used in this fashion may be defined through

      configuration can sometimes fall into this category. Another use
      case is if a oneshot service shall not be executed each time
      when they are pulled in as a dependency, but only the first
      time.</p><p>For this, systemd knows the setting
      <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code><code class="option">yes</code>, which
      causes systemd to consider the unit to be active if the start
      action exited successfully. This directive can be used with all

      will consider the service to be in the process of initialization
      while the original program is still running. Once it exits
      successfully and at least a process remains (and
      <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code><code class="option">no</code>), the
      service is considered started.</p><p>Often, a traditional daemon only consists of one process.
      Therefore, if only one process is left after the original
      process terminates, systemd will consider that process the main
      process of the service. In that case, the
