//! The RuntimeInfo encapsulates all information rustysd needs to do its job. The units, the pid and filedescriptors and the rustysd config.
//! In the lifetime of ruytsd there will only ever be one RuntimeInfo which is passed wrapped inside the ArcMutRuntimeInfo.
//!
//! The idea here is to make as much as possible concurrently readable while still being able to get exclusive access to e.g. remove units.
//! Note that units themselves contain RWLocks so they can be worked on concurrently as long as no write() lock is placed on the RuntimeInfo.
